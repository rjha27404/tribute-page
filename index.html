            <h2 class="center">Here's a time line of Dr. Borlaug's life:</h2>
            <ul class="center">
                <li><b>1914</b>- Born in Cresco, Iowa</li>
                <br>

                <br>
                <li><b>1935</b>- Has to stop school and save up more money. Works in the Civilian <br>Conservation Corps, helping starving Americans. "I saw how food changed them", he said. "All of this left scars on me."</li>
                <br>
                <li><b>1937</b>- Finishes university and takes a job in the US Forestry Service</li>
                <br>
                <li><b>1938</b>- Marries wife of 69 years Margret Gibson. Gets laid off due to budget cuts. <br>Inspired by Elvin Charles Stakman, he returns to school study under Stakman, who teaches him about breeding pest-resistent plants.</li>
                <br>
                <li><b>1941</b> - Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl Harbor attack, but is rejected. <br>Instead, the military asked his lab to work on waterproof glue, <br>DDT to control malaria, disinfectants, and other applied science.</li>
                <br>
                <li><b>1942</b> - Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Pathology</li>
                <br>
                <li><b>1944</b> - Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont, leaves behind his pregnant wife, <br>and flies to Mexico to head a new plant pathology program. Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000 different strains of disease resistent wheat - including different varieties for each major climate on Earth.</li>
                <br>
                <li><b>1945</b> - Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each season, doubling wheat yields</li>
                <br>
                <li><b>1953</b> - crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a high-yeidling American breed,<br> creating a strain that responds well to fertilizer. It goes on to provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.</li>
                <li><b>1962</b> - Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding strains of wheat to the Indian subcontinent<br> in time to help mitigate mass starvation due to a rapidly expanding population
                </li><br>
                <li><b>1970</b> - receives the Nobel Peace Prize</li>
                <br>
                <li><b>1983</b> - helps seven African countries dramatically increase their maize and sorghum yields</li>
                <br>
                <li><b>1984</b> - becomes a distinguished professor at Texas A&M University</li>
                <br>
                <li><b>2005</b> - states "we will have to double the world food supply by 2050." <br>Argues that genetically modified crops are the only way we can meet the demand, as we run out of arable land.<br> Says that GM crops are not inherently dangerous because "we've been genetically modifying <br>plants and animals for a long time. Long before we called it science, people were selecting the best breeds."</li>
                <br>
                <li><b>2009</b> - dies at the age of 95.</li>
                <br><br>
                "Borlaug's life and achievement are testimony to the far-reaching contribution that one man's towering intellect, persistence and scientific vision can make to human peace and progress."

                <br>-- Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh
